## Description

I am learning to code, by creatign a webpage, using HTML, JS, GIT, CSS

- I was motivated as I have always been interested in coding, I own a marketplace and want to change roles.
- I built this project to learn the basics and then be able to apply professionally.
- For me, it solves the problem not to depend on anybody else. Also to find more meaning in my work.
- So far I've learned the basics of coding.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
